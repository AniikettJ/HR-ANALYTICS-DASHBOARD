**📌 Project Overview**

This project analyzes employee attrition patterns to identify key drivers behind workforce turnover.
The dashboard provides HR decision-makers with actionable insights into employee retention, satisfaction, salary distribution, and tenure trends.

Built using Power BI, this solution integrates ETL, data modeling, and advanced DAX measures to deliver an interactive executive-level HR analytics dashboard.

**🎯 Business Problem**

Employee attrition increases recruitment cost, impacts productivity, and affects organizational stability.
The objective of this project is to:

Identify high-risk employee segments
Analyze attrition across gender, department, salary band, and tenure
Provide insights for data-driven HR strategies

Power BI (Dashboard & DAX)
Power Query (Data Cleaning & Transformation)
DAX (KPI & Risk Calculations)
SQL (Data Analysis Queries)
IBM HR Analytics Dataset (Kaggle)

**🧹 Data Cleaning & Transformation (Power Query)**
Performed ETL operations including:
